# memeGeneratorV1.0
Udacity's iOS Nanodegree MemeGenerator 1.0

This was the second project app for Udacity's iOS Nanodegree. It was meant to familiarize the students with the basics of using UIKit, implementing the UI components that are commonly present in iOS apps.

What did I learn how to do?

- Access the Camera and Photo Album using the UIImagePickerController
- Understand how Swift optionals, closures, collections, classes, structs and protocols are used in iOS apps
- Create Actions and Outlets with extremely high proficiency
- Use a UIActivityViewController to share media with Facebook, Twitter, SMS, and Email
- Describe the delegate pattern and give a full account of its importance and uses in iOS classes
